## Experience to maintain repo
It was the first time for me to maintain my repository as well as to contribute other people's works.
It found it fun but it took me time to get used to the system of GitHub.
## Experience to review PRs
It was thrilling to see my abstract get contentful by pulling other students' contribution.
However, I found it was a little troublesome when there is a conflicting pull request and I had to manage them somehow.
## Lessons learnt
In these lessons I learned that, above all, it is important to ask other programmers when I seem to be stuck.
Right after asking my classmate about creating a pull request, I could work on the task more efficiently.
